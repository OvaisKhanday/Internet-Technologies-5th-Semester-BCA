# Internet-Technologies-5th-Semester-BCA
A project based on the concepts taught in the 5th semester of BCA. This is supposed to help earnest students to get the most out of the Internet Technologies.

It actually has three modules the WebDevlop module is kind of a basic overview to the field of front-end development. Then comes the JDBCConnection module that suffices
the need of knowledge of database connectivity. At the end comes the Internet Technologies module, which implements the erstwhile modules to build a coherent module, which
can be used by students to under the majority of the concepts taught in the 5th semester Internet Technologies subject.

--> hope it would help you understand the concepts better. Hope you better a future ahead.
